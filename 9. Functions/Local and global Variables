Local Variabels
- variabel defnined inside a function are known as automatic local variabel
- they are automatically"create"each time the function is called
- their values are local to the function

Global Variables
- the opposite of a local variabel
- global variabel value can be accessed by any function in the the program 
- a global variabel has the lifetime of the program

Example 
int myglobal = 0; 

int main ()
{
  void myLocalMain = 0;
return;
}

void myFunction()
{
  int x;
}

Avoid Using global variables
