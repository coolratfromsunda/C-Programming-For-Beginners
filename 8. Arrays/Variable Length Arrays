Variabel length array
- so far, all the sizes of an array have been specified using a number
- the term variabel invariabel-lenght array does not mean that you can modify the length of the array after you creat it
- a VLA keeps the same size after creation
- variabel lenght array allow you to specify the size of an array with a variabel when creating an array
- C99 introduced variabel -lenght array primarily to allow c to become a better language for numerical computing 
- VLAS make it easier to convert exixting libraries if FORTRAN numerical calculation routines to C

Valid and invalid declarations of an array 

int n=5;
int m=8;
float a1[5];
float a2[5*2+1];
float a3[sizeof(int) + 1];
float a4[-4];
float a6[2,5];
float a7[(int)2,5];
float a8[n];
float a9[m];

Hints
- the criteria that be used to identify a prime is that a number is considered prime if it is 
not eveny divisible by any other previous prime number

- can use the following as an exit condition in the innermost loop
- p / primes[i]>=orimes[i]
- a test to ensure that the value of p does not exceed the aquare root of primes[i]

- you program can be more efficient by skipping any checks for even numbers (as they cannot be prime)
