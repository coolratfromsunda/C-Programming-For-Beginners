Requirements
- in this challenge , you are to creat a C program that uses a two-dimensional array in a weather program
- this program will find the total rainfall for each year, the average yearly rainfall, and the average 
rainfall for each month
- input will be a 2D array with hard-code values for rainfall amounts for the past 5 years
- the array should have 5 rows and 2 columns
- rainfall amounts can be floaing point numbers

Example output

hints
- initialize your 2D array with hard rainfall amounts
- remember, to iterate through  2D array you will need a nested loop
- the key to this solution will be to visualize a 2d array and understand how o iterate through one, via 
a nested loop 
- as yuo are iterating , you can keep a running total(outer loop iterate by year, inner loop iterate by month)
to get the total rainfall for all years

- to get the average monthly rainfall, iterate though the 2D array by having the outer loop go through 
each month and the inner loop go through each year
